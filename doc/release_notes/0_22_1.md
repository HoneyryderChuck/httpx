# 0.22.1

## Bugfixes

* `:retries` plugin: fix `HTTPX::Response#response to point to last possible response in the redirection chain.
* `:stream` plugin: Make `HTTPX::Session#request` public (as it is inn the main class) .
* return 100 responses if the request didn't specifically ask for "100-continue" negotiation (via the "expect" header).

## Improvements

Wrap low-level socket errors in a `HTTPX::ConnectionError` exception.
