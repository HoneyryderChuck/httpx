# 0.10.0

## Features

### Streaming Requests

The `stream` plugin adds functionality to handle long-lived stream responses, such as the Twitter Streaming API:

```ruby
http = HTTPX.plugin(:stream)

http.get(stream_api_endpoint, stream: true).each_line do |line|
  payload = JSON.parse(line)
  # do smth with this
end
```

### Rate Limiter

The `rate_limiter` plugin adds functionality for automatically hooking into rate-limiting responses coming from the server, and waits-and-retries them according to what the server advertises.

```ruby
HTTPX.plugin(:rate_limiter).get(rate_limited_api_endpoint)
# => 429 Too Many Requests .... Retry-After: 3
# waits 3 seconds before retrying
```

### Ruby 3

This release is the first testing against and targeting Ruby 3 and some of the new features.

It ships with RBS signatures for all of the client-facing APIs. There's non 100% typinng coverage yet, but I'm gradually (pun intended) working on it.


## Improvements

### IDN support

Requests where the domains are formed by non-ASCII characters, are now supported (if you're using ruby 2.3 or more recent).

```ruby
HTTPX.get("http://b√ºcher.ch") # it works!
```

### cookies plugin full implementation


The `cookies` plugin is now independent of 3rd-party gems. The motivation for this was that `http-cookie` was dependent of both `domain_name` and `unf` gems, which are currently unusable in ruby 3, and haven't received any update in the last 3 years.

The implementation is still compliant with RFC6265, and all of the features provided in earlier versions were ported, exceptwhen loading the cookie jar stored in a Netscape-format file or Mozilla sqlite database, which were not documented for `httpx` anyway, and I considered too niche to backport. If you feel `httpx` should support those, do let me know.

Some code from these gems, including the ruby punycode implementation, is now part of the source tree, along with its licenses and attribution mentions.

## Bugfixes


Several edge-case bugs have been fixed solely by the integration of RBS runtime type checking, including some bugs around closing a connection pool that can cause loops.


## Regressions

`HTTPX::ErrorResponse`'s methods `#headers` and `#reason` were removed, as they didn't provide much value. Consider calling `#raise_for_status` or checking the API (`is_a?(HTTPX::ErrorResponse)` or `respond_to?(:error)` are strategies for this).
