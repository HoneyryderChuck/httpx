# 0.18.5

## Improvements

* ruby 3.1 is now officially supported.
* when a user sets a `Host` header for an HTTP/2 request, this will be used in the `:authority` HTTP/2 pseudo-header, instead of silently ignored (mimicking what "curl" does).

## Bugfixes

* fixed "throw outside of catch block" error happening when pipelining requests on an HTTP/1 connection and resulting in a timeout.
