# 0.21.0

## Features

### `:write_timeout`, `:read_timeout` and `:request_timeout`

https://gitlab.com/honeyryderchuck/httpx/-/wikis/Timeouts

The following timeouts are now supported:

* `:write_timeout`: total time (in seconds) to write a request to the server;
* `:read_timeout`: total time (in seconds) to read aa response from the server;
* `:request_timeout`: tracks both of the above (time to write the request and read a response);

```ruby
HTTPX.with(timeout: { request_timeout: 60}).get(...
```

Just like `:connect_timeout`, the new timeouts are deadline-oriented, rather than op-oriented, meaning that they do not reset on each socket operation (as most ruby HTTP clients do).

None of them has a default value, in order not to break integrations, but that'll change in a future v1, where they'll become the default timeouts.

### Circuit Breaker plugin

https://gitlab.com/honeyryderchuck/httpx/-/wikis/Circuit-Breaker

The `:circuit_breaker` plugin wraps around errors happening when performing HTTP requests, and support options for setting maximum number of attempts before circuit opens (`:circuit_breaker_max_attempts`), period after which attempts should be reset (`:circuit_breaker_reset_attempts_in`), timespan until circuit half-opens (`circuit_breaker_break_in`), respective half-open drip rate (`:circuit_breaker_half_open_drip_rate`), and a callback to do your own check on whether a response has failed, in case you want HTTP level errors to be marked as failed attempts (`:circuit_breaker_break_on`).

```ruby
http = HTTPX.plugin(:circuit_breaker)
# that's it!
http.get(...
```

### WebDAV plugin

https://gitlab.com/honeyryderchuck/httpx/-/wikis/WebDav

The `:webdav` introduces some "convenience" methods to perform common WebDAV operations.

```ruby
webdav = HTTPX.plugin(:webdav, origin: "http://webdav-server")
              .plugin(:digest_authentication).digest_auth("user", "pass")

res = webdav.put("/file.html", body: "this is the file body")
res = webdav.copy("/file.html", "/newdir/copy.html")
# ...
```

### XML transcoder, `:xml` option and `response.xml`

A new transcoder was added fot the XML mime type, which requires `"nokogiri"` to be installed; it can both serialize Nokogiri nodes in a request, and parse response content into nokogiri nodes:

```ruby
response = HTTPX.post("https://xml-server.com", xml: Nokogiri::XML("<xml ..."))
response.xml #=> #(Document:0x16e4 { name = "document", children = ...
```

## Improvements

### `:proxy` plugin: `:no_proxy` option

Support was added, in the `:proxy` plugin, to declare domains, either via regexp patterns, or strings, for which requests should bypass the proxy.

```ruby
http = HTTPX.plugin(:proxy).with_proxy(
    uri: "http://10.10.0.1:51432",
    no_proxy: ["gitlab.local", /*.google.com/]
)
http.get("https://duckduckgo.com/?q=httpx") #=> proxied
http.get("https://google.com/?q=httpx") #=> not proxied
http.get("https://gitlab.com") #=> proxied
http.get("https://gitlab.local") #=> not proxied
```

### OOTB support for other JSON libraries

If one of `multi_json`, `oj` or `yajl` is available, all `httpx` operations doing JSON parsing or dumping will use it (the `json` standard library will be used otherwise).

```ruby
require "oj"
require "httpx"

response = HTTPX.post("https://somedomain.json", json: { "foo" => "bar" }) # will use "oj"
puts response.json # will use "oj"
```

## Bugfixes

* `:expect` plugin: `:expect_timeout` can accept floats (not just integers).

## Chore

* DoH `:https` resolver: support was removed for the "application/dns-json" mime-type (it was only supported in practice by the Google DoH resolver, which has since added support for the standardized "application/dns-message").
