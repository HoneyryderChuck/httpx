# 0.18.4

## Improvements

* faraday adapter: added support for `#on_data` callback in order to support [faraday streaming](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/usage/streaming).

* multipart plugin: removed support for file mime type detection using `mime-types`. The reasoning behind it was that `mime-types` uses the filename, which is a very inaccurate detection strategy (ex: an mp4 video will be identified as `application/mp4`, instead of the correct `video/mp4`).
* multipart plugin: supported for file mime type detection using `marcel` and `filemagic` was added. Both use the magic header bytes, which is a more accurate strategy for file type detection.

## Bugfixes

* webmock adapter has been reimplemented to work with `httpx` plugins (such as the `:retries` plugin). Some other fixes were applied to make it work better under `vcr` (a common `webmock` extension).

* fixed the URI-related bug which was making requests stall under ruby 3.1 (still not officially testing against it).
