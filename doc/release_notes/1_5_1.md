# 1.5.1

## Bugfixes

* connection errors on persistent connections which have just been checked out from the pool no longer account for retries bookkeeping; the assumption should be that, if a connection has been checked into the pool in an open state, chances are, when it eventually gets checked out, it may be corrupt. This issue was more exacerbated in `:persistent` plugin connections, which by design have a retry of 1, thus failing often immediately after check out without a legitimate request try.
* native resolver: fix issue with process interrupts during DNS request, which caused a busy loop when closing the selector.
