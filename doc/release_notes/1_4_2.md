# 1.4.2

## Bugfixes

* faraday: use default reason when none is matched by Net::HTTP::STATUS_CODES
* native resolver: keep sending DNS queries if the socket is available, to avoid busy loops on select
* native resolver fixes for Happy Eyeballs v2
  * do not apply resolution delay if the IPv4 IP was not resolved via DNS
  * ignore ALIAS if DNS response carries IP answers
  * do not try to query for names already awaiting answer from the resolver
  * make sure all types of errors are propagated to connections
  * make sure next candidate is picked up if receiving NX_DOMAIN_NOT_FOUND error from resolver
* raise error happening before any request is flushed to respective connections (avoids loop on non-actionable selector termination).
* fix "NoMethodError: undefined method `after' for nil:NilClass", happening for requests flushed into persistent connections which errored, and were retried in a different connection before triggering the timeout callbacks from the previously-closed connection.


## Chore

* Refactor of timers to allow for explicit and more performant single timer interval cancellation.
* default log message restructured to include info about process, thread and caller.
