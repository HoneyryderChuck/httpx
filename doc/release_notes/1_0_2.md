# 1.0.2

## Breaking changes

The datadog `ddtrace` integration supports only version 1.13.0 or higher. Some internal API changes from the gem made it untenable to support older versions cleanly, so I'm including this breaking change as part of the 1.x release train to diminish the support overhead. If you're relying on this integration on this integration and are already using v1, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I'll accept patches to reintroduce support for older versions, otherwise upgrade to a supported version of `ddtrace`, or revert to a 0.x version of httpx.


## bugfixes

* bump `http-2-next` to 1.0.1, which fixes a bug where http/2 connection interprets MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS as request cap.
