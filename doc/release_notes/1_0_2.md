# 1.0.2

## bugfixes

* bump `http-2-next` to 1.0.1, which fixes a bug where http/2 connection interprets MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS as request cap.
* `grpc`: setup of rpc calls from camel-cased symbols has been fixed. As an improvement, the GRPC-enabled session will now support both snake-cased, as well as camel-cased calls.
* `datadog` adapter has now been patched to support the most recent breaking changes of `ddtrace` configuration DSL (`env_to_bool` is no longer supported).
