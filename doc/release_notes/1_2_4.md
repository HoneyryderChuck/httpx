# 1.2.4

## Bugfixes

* fixed issue related to inability to buffer payload to error responses (which may happen on certain error handling situations).
* fixed recovery from a lost persistent connection leaving process due to ping being sent while still marked as inactive.
* fixed datadog integration, which was not generating new spans on retried requests (when `:retries` plugin is enabled).
* fixed splitting strings into key value pairs in cases where the value would contain a "=", such as in certain base64 payloads.
