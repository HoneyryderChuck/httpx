# 1.0.0

## Breaking changes

* the minimum supported ruby version is 2.7.0 .
* The default support for IDNA 2003 has been removed. If you require this feature, install the [idnx gem](https://github.com/HoneyryderChuck/idnx), which `httpx` automatically integrates with when available.

### Support removed for deprecated APIs

* The deprecated `HTTPX::Client` constant lookup has been removed (use `HTTPX::Session` instead).
* The deprecated `HTTPX.timeout({...})` function has been removed (use `HTTPX.with(timeout: {...})` instead).
* The deprecated `HTTPX.headers({...})` function has been removed (use `HTTPX.with(headers: {...})` instead).
* The deprecated `HTTPX.plugins(...)` function has been removed (use `HTTPX.plugin(...).plugin(...)...` instead).
* The deprecated `:transport_options` option, which was only valid for UNIX connections, has been removed (use `:addresses` instead).
* The deprecated `def_option(...)` function, previously used to define additional options in plugins, has been removed (use `def option_$new_option)` instead).
* The deprecated `:loop_timeout` timeout option has been removed.
* `:stream` plugin: the deprecated `HTTPX::InstanceMethods::StreamResponse` has been removed (use `HTTPX::StreamResponse` instead).
* The deprecated usage of symbols to indicate HTTP verbs (i.e. `HTTPX.request(:get, ...)` or `HTTPX.build_request(:get, ...)`) is not supported anymore (use the upcase string always, i.e. `HTTPX.request("GET", ...)` or `HTTPX.build_request("GET", ...)`, instead).
* The deprecated `HTTPX::ErrorResponse#status` method has been removed (use `HTTPX::ErrorResponse#error` instead).
