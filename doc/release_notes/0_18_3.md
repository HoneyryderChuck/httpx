## Bugfixes

* request bodies eager-loaded from enumerables yield duped partial chunks.

An error was observed while looking at webmock integration, where requests formed via the multipart plugin were returning an empty string as body. The issue was caused by an optimization on multipart encoder, which reuses the same buffer when reading chunks. Unfortunately, these cannot be yielded the same way via IO.copy_stream, as the same (cleared) buffer will be used to generate the eager-loaded body chunks.
