* skip resolution delay path for early resolve cases

when the early resolve path (using IP, /etc/hosts IP, IP from cache) is followed, emit_addresses is called, and in a particular case (dual-stack network but using an IPv4 address), the happy eyeballs resolution delay path was activated when it shouldn't (it's meant to be used only for DNS network requests), and resulted in @pool being called before it was ever set. This simple check ensures that it doesn't happen before it must.
