# 0.3.0

* removed `http_parser.rb`, which is unmaintained, builds an old version of node's parser, and doesn't work on JRuby 9.2; also, better support over HTTP/1 features.

* Alt-Svc support (all remaining origin requests will be routed there); Supports both `Alt-Svc` header and the `altsvc` HTTP/2 frame.

* moved multipart requests support to a separate plugin, which removed `http_form_data` as a hard dependency (you'll still need it for the plugin though).

* new `HTTP.wrap { |client| }` method.

* We have a cheatsheet!Â
