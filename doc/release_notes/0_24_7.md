# 0.24.6

## dependencies

`http-2-next` last supported version for the 0.x series is the last version before v1. This shoul ensure that older versions of `httpx` won't be affected by any of the recent breaking changes.

## Bugfixes

* `grpc`: setup of rpc calls from camel-cased symbols has been fixed. As an improvement, the GRPC-enabled session will now support both snake-cased, as well as camel-cased calls.
* `datadog` adapter has now been patched to support the most recent breaking changes of `ddtrace` configuration DSL (`env_to_bool` is no longer supported).
