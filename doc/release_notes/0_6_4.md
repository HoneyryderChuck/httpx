# 0.6.4

This release takes where the last left off, and makes a concerted effort to improve both the test coverage and the number of features for which there are functional tests.

## Improvements

* Running Ruby 2.7 with no warnings;

* Test suite now has functional tests for:
  * authentication on proxies (http, socks4a, socks5);
  * DNS-over-HTTPS;
  * connect timeouts (still a bit flaky though);

* Improved test coverage of project to 90%;

* building website/blog with Jekyll 4;

## Bugfixes

* fixed regressions on HTTP, SOCKS4a and SOCKS5 proxy authentication;
* fixed DNS-over-HTTPS implementation to be compliant with the latest RFC;
