# 0.22.0

## Improvements

### Happy Eyeballs v2 finalized

Until now, httpx was issuing concurrent DNS requests, but it'd only start connecting to the first, and then on the following by the right order, but sequentially.

`httpx` will now establish connections concurrently to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses of a given domain; the first one to succeed terminates the other. Successful connection means completion of both TCP and TLS (when applicable) handshakes.

### HTTPX::Response::Body#encoding

A new method, `#encoding`, can be called on response bodies. It'll return the encoding of the response payload.
