# 1.2.3

## Improvements

* `:retries` plugin: allow `:max_retries` set to 0 (allows for a soft disable of retries when using the faraday adapter).

## Bugfixes

* `:oauth` plugin: fix for default auth method being ignored when setting grant type and scope as options only.
*  ensure happy eyeballs-initiated cloned connections also set session callbacks (caused issues when server would respond with a 421 response, an event requiring a valid internal callback).
*  native resolver cleanly transitions from tcp to udp after truncated DNS query (causing issues on follow-up CNAME resolution).
* elapsing timeouts now guard against mutation of callbacks while looping (prevents skipping callbacks in situations where a previous one would remove itself from the collection).

## Chore

* datadog adapter: do not call `.lazy` on options (avoids deprecation warning, to be removed in ddtrace 2.0)
