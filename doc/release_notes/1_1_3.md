# 1.1.3

## improvements

## security

* when using `:follow_redirects` plugin, the "authorization" header will be removed when following redirect responses to a different origin.

## bugfixes

* fixed `:stream` plugin not following redirect responses when used with the `:follow_redirects` plugin.
* fixed `:stream` plugin not doing content decoding when responses were p.ex. gzip-compressed.
* fixed bug preventing usage of IPv6 loopback or link-local addresses in the request URL in systems with no IPv6 internet connectivity (the request was left hanging).
* protect all code which may initiate a new connection from abrupt errors (such as internet turned off), as it was done on the initial request call.

## chore

internal usage of `mutex_m` has been removed (`mutex_m` is going to be deprecated in ruby 3.3).
