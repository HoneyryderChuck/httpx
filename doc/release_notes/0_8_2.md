# 0.8.2

## Features

* `:expect` plugin now supports a new option, `:expect_threshold_size`, meaning: the byte size threshold below which no `expect` header will be sent with requests with payload.
* `:compression` plugin now supports a new option, `:compression_threshold_size`, meaning: the bytesize threshold below which request payload won't be compressed before being sent.
* for HTTP/2 connections, when `keep_alive_timeout` expires, a `PING` frame is used to check connection availability; if successful, the connection will be reused.
