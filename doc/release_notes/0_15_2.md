# 0.15.2

## Bugfixes

* Fixed cookie management for same-keys: before the fix, cookies with same-key, same-domain and same-path were all being sent in subsequent requests, which violates  RFC 6265 - 5.4 . As of now, only the last valid cookie for a given key/domain/path will be kept, evicting the others.

## Chore

* debug logs were inserting ASCII code string wrappers, even when no color was set. It nonw only sends the plain string.
