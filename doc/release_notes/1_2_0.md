# 1.2.0

## Features

### `:ssrf_filter` plugin

The `:ssrf_filter` plugin prevents server-side request forgery attacks, by blocking requests to the internal network. This is useful when the URLs used to perform requests arenâ€™t under the developer control (such as when they are inserted via a web application form).

```ruby
http = HTTPX.plugin(:ssrf_filter)

# this works
response = http.get("https://example.com")

# this doesn't
response = http.get("http://localhost:3002")
response = http.get("http://[::1]:3002")
response = http.get("http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/")
```

### `:callbacks` plugin

The session callbacks introduced in v0.24.0 are in its own plugin. Older code will still work and emit a deprecation warning.

### `:redirect_on` option for `:follow_redirects` plugin

This option allows passing a callback which, when returning `false`, can interrupt the redirect loop.

```ruby
http = HTTPX.plugin(:follow_redirects).with(redirect_on: ->(location_uri) { BLACKLIST_HOSTS.include?(location_uri.host) })
```

### `:close_on_handshake_timeout` timeout

A new `:timeout` option, `:close_handshake_timeout`, is added, which monitors connection readiness when performing HTTP/2 connection termination handshake.

## Improvements

* Internal "eden connections" concept was removed, and connection objects are now kept-and-reused during the lifetime of a session, even when closed. This simplified connectio pool implementation and improved performance.
* request using `:proxy` and `:retries` plugin enabled sessions will now retry on proxy connection establishment related errors.

## Bugfixes

* webmock adapter: mocked responses storing decoded payloads won't try to decode them again (fixes vcr/webmock integrations).
* webmock adapter: fix issue related with making real requests over webmock-enabled connection.
