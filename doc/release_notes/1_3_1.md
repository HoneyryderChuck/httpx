# 1.3.1

## Improvements

* `:request_timeout` will be applied to all HTTP interactions until the final responses returned to the caller. That includes:
  * all redirect requests/responses (when using the `:follow_redirects` plugin)
  * all retried requests/responses (when using the `:retries` plugin)
  * intermediate requests (such as "100-continue")
* faraday adapter: allow further plugins of internal session (ex: `builder.adapter(:httpx) { |sess| sess.plugin(:follow_redirects) }...`)

## Bugfixes

* fix connection leak on proxy auth failed (407) handling
* fix busy loop on deferred requests for the duration interval
* do not further enqueue deferred requests if they have terminated meanwhile.
* fix busy loop caused by coalescing connections when one of them is on the DNS resolution phase still.
* faraday adapter: on parallel mode, skip calling `on_complete` when not defined.
