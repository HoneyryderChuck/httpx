# 0.0.4

* Added ANSI coloring to the debugging output (when in TTY mode).

* `HTTPX::HTTPError` exceptions now carry the full response object, instead of just the status (so the user can inspect the body and headers if it so desires).

* Fixed a bug related with HTTP/1 multiple requests on a domain which closed connections not being able to open a new socket to the domain.
