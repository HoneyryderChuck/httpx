# 1.4.3

## Bugfixes

* `webmock` adapter: reassign headers to signature after callbacks are called (these may change the headers before virtual send).
* do not close request (and its body) right after sending, instead only on response close
  * prevents retries from failing under the `:retries` plugin
  * fixes issue when using `faraday-multipart` request bodies
* retry request with HTTP/1 when receiving an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame with `HTTP_1_1_REQUIRED` error code.
* fix wrong method call on HTTP/2 PING frame with unrecognized code.
* fix EOFError issues on connection termination for long running connections which may have already been terminated by peer and were wrongly trying to complete the HTTP/2 termination handshake.
