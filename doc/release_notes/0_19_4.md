# 0.19.4

## Improvements

### Jruby: HTTP/2 with jruby-openssl (>= 0.12.2)

The (optional) FFI-based TLS module for jruby was deleted. Besides it being cumbersome and hard to maintain, `jruby`'s own `openssl` released support for ALPN negotiation (in v0.12.2), which solves the problem the deleted module was supposed to address.

## Bugfixes

* `webmock` integration was fixed to take the mocked URI query string into account.
* fix internal codepath where mergeable-but-not-coalescable connections were still triggering the coalesce branch.
* fixed after-use mutation of connection addresses array which was making it empty after initial usage.
* fixed a "busy loop" caused by long-running native resolver not signaling it had "nothing to do".
