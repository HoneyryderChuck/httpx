# 0.6.5

This release fixes important bugs, and automates the PKI for the test suite.

## Features

* `resolver_options` can now receive a `:cache` flag (default: `true`). This bypasses caching and forces the lookup;

## Improvements

* Building the TLS certs necessary for the test suite has been scripted, after the initial certs expired and brought the CI to a halt;
* All DNS resolvers have a functional test, both for the happy as well as the error case;
* Added functional tests for HTTP and HTTPS proxy with authentication, making all proxy options now tested with authentication;


## Bugfixes

* native and https DNS resolvers weren't usable after a resolving error;
* system DNS resolver could halt the system after a dns resolving error;
* fixed system halt on HTTP proxy authentication error;
