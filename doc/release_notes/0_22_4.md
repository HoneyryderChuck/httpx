# 0.22.4

## Bugfixes

* fix happy eyeballs v2 bug where, once the first connection would be established, the remaining one would still end up in the coalescing loop, thereby closing itself via the `:tcp_open` callback.
* fix for faraday plugin parallel mode, where it'd hang if no requests would be made in the parallel block (@catlee)
