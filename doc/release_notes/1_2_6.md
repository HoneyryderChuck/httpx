# 1.2.6

## Improvements

* `native` resolver: when timing out on DNS query for an alias, retry the DNS query for the alias (instead of the original hostname).

## Bugfixes

* `faraday` adapter: set `env` options on the request object, so they are available in the request object when yielded.
* `follow_redirects` plugin: remove body-related headers (`content-length`, `content-type`) on POST-to-GET redirects.
* `follow_redirects` plugin: maintain verb (and body) of original request when the response status code is 307.
* `native` resolver: when timing out on TCP-based name resolution, downgrade to UDP before retrying.
* `rate_limiter` plugin: do not try fetching the retry-after of error responses.
