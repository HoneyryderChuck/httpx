# 1.2.2

## Bugfixes

* only raise "unknown option" error when option is not supported, not anymore when error happens in the setup of a support option.
* usage of `HTTPX::Session#wrap` within a thread with other sessions using the `:persistent` plugin won't inadvertedly terminate its open connections.
* terminate connections on `IOError` (`SocketError` does not cover them).
* terminate connections on HTTP/2 protocol and handshake errors, which happen during establishment or termination of a HTTP/2 connection (they were being previously kept around, although they'd irrecoverable).
* `:oauth` plugin: fixing check preventing the OAuth metadata server integration path to be exercised.
* fix instantiation of the options headers object with the wrong headers class.
