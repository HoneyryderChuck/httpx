# 0.5.1

## Improvements

* Fixed flakiness of test suite introduced in the 0.4 versions;
* compression plugin:
  * do not send `accept-encoding` header when `range` is present;
  * Remove from `content-encoding` if body stream decodes it;
  * Added `HTTPX::Response::Body#encodings` to return the decoded encoding(s);

## Bugfixes

* non-UTF-8 bodies weren't being properly handled, which led to a loop report (`slice` -> `byteslice`);
* connection reuse now also happens for requests with body (it was only working with `GET`s and other bodyless requests before);
