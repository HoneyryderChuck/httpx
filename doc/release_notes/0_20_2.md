## Bugfixes

* fix for selector timeout errors closing all connections and ignoring resolvers.

Timeout errors on select were being propagated to all pooled connections, although not all of them were being selected on, and not all of them having timed out. plus, resolver timeouts were doing the same, making connections fail with connection timeout error, rather than resolve timeout error. A patch was implemented, where the selector now yields an error to the selected connections, rather than plain raising exception.
