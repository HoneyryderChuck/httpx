# 1.3.0

## Dependencies

`http-2` v1.0.0 is replacing `http-2-next` as the HTTP/2 parser.

`http-2-next` was forked from `http-2` 5 years ago; its improvements have been merged back to `http-2` recently though, so `http-2-next` willl therefore no longer be maintained.

## Improvements

Request-specific options (`:params`, `:form`, `:json` and `:xml`) are now separately kept by the request, which allows them to share `HTTPX::Options`, and reduce the number of copying / allocations.

This means that `HTTPX::Options` will throw an error if you initialize an object which such keys; this should not happen, as this class is considered internal and you should not be using it directly.

## Fixes

* support for the `datadog` gem v2.0.0 in its adapter has been unblocked, now that the gem has been released.
* loading the `:cookies` plugin was making the `Session#build_request` private.
