# 0.1.0

* Follow Redirects Plugin: Added `:follow_insecure_redirects` option, which will not follow https-to-http redirects.

* Allow optional option `:transport`. TCP sockets are the default tranport, but by passing `:unix`, one can also define it as a UNIX socket. 

* Added Retries Plugin, which will retry a request a certain amount of times, provided that the request is safe.

* Proxy Plugin: allow multiple proxies to be passed. The client will perform requests on the first proxy successfully connected.
