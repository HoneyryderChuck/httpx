# 0.24.1

## Improvements

* datadog adapter: support `:service_name` configuration option.
* datadog adapter: set `:distributed_tracing` to `true` by default.
* `:proxy` plugin: when the proxy uri uses an unsupported scheme (i.e.: "scp://125.24.2.1"), a more user friendly error is raised (instead of the previous broken stacktrace).

## Bugfixes

* datadog adapter: fix tracing enable call, which was wrongly calling `super`.
+ `:proxy` plugin: fix for bug which was turning off plugins overriding `HTTPX::Connection#send` (such as the datadog adapter).
