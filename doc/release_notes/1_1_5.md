# 1.1.5

## improvements

* pattern matching support for responses has been backported to ruby 2.7 as well.

## bugfixes

* `stream` plugin: fix for `HTTPX::StreamResponse#each_line` not yielding the last line of the payload when not delimiter-terminated.
* `stream` plugin: fix `webmock` adapter integration when methods calls would happen in the `HTTPX::StreamResponse#each` block.
* `stream` plugin: fix `:follow_redirects` plugin integration which was caching the redirect response and using it for method calls inside the `HTTPX::StreamResponse#each` block.
* "103 early hints" responses will be ignored when processing the response (it was causing the response returned by sesssions to hold its headers, instead of the following 200 response, while keeping the 200 response body).
