# 0.5.0

This release is a minor bump only because it introduces a new dependency:

## the `timers` gem

We've introduced the [`timers` gem](https://github.com/socketry/timers) as a dependency to deal with total timeouts, thereby making the timeout object only a container of values to be refactored. This was in itself a small gain for such a big addition, but other future time-based features can be best built upon it than the existing work.
