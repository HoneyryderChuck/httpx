# 0.15.1

## Bugfixes

Fixed HTTP/1 connection accounting on requests:

* when persistent, Connection: close will be set based on the request position on the batch against the allowed requests on the open connection.
* when not persistent, Connnection: close will be set on the last request of the batch, being the batch a subset based on allowed requests, or the whole of it.
