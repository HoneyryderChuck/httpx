# 0.0.3

* Added `HTTPX::Response#raise_for_status`. If there was an error response, it will raise it's exception. If the HTTP response has a 4xx or 5xx error, it will raise an `HTTPX::HTTPError` exception (this feature was inspired by a similar feature in python requests library).

* Added `HTTPX::Client#wrap`, which allows to use the client inside a block and keep connections open, without resorting to the initializer only.

* TCP connection establishment errors are now wrapped in error responses, like other possible errors.

* SSL non-blocking connection API is now in use (it was previously using the blocking connect API, and was breaking the hackernews script from time to time. Now I'm looking at you, DNS).
