# 0.6.7

## Bugfixes

* An error was reported when using the follow plugin allowing insecure redirects: if the insecure redirect would be for the same host, and the original request was performed with HTTP/2, the library would try to coalesce the request, and blocks the reactor. A check was made to ensure that connection only coalesces if both are https connections.
