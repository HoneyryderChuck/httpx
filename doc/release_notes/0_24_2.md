# 0.24.2

## Improvements

* besides an array, `:resolver_options` can now receive a hash for `:nameserver`, which **must** be indexed by IP family (`Socket::AF_INET6` or `Socket::AF_INET`); each group of nameservers will be used for emitting DNS queries of that iP family.
* `:authentication` plugin: Added `#bearer_auth` helper, which receives a token, and sets it as `"Bearer $TOKEN` in the `"authorization"` header.
* `faraday` adapter: now implements `#build_connection` and `#close`, will now interact with `faraday` native timeouts (`:read`, `:write` and `:connect`).


## Bugfixes

* fixed native resolver bug when queries involving intermediate alias would be kept after the original query and mess with re-queries.
