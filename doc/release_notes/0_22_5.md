# 0.22.5

## Bugfixes

* `datadog` and `sentry` integrations did not account for `Connection#send` being possibly called multiple times (something possible for connection coalescing, max requests exhaustion, or Happy Eyeballs 2), and were registering multiple `on(:response)` callbacks. Requests are now marked when decorated the first time.
* Happy Eyeballs handshake "connect errors" routine is now taking both name resolution errors, as well as TLS handshake errors, into account, when the handshake fails.
