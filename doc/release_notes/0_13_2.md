# 0.13.2

## Improvements

`UDPSocket#sendmsg_nonblock` is now used in the native resolver.

## Bugfixes

Usage in Windows was buggy, resulting in `Errno::EINVAL` during DNS resolving, when using the native resolver. This was due to a discrepancy between `recvfrom` behaviour in WS Sockets and Linux Sockets. This was fixed by making we the UDP socket never tries to receive before a DNS query has been actually sent.
