# 0.6.6

## Features

* The `retries` plugin receives two new options:
  * `retry_on`: a callable that receives the failed response as an argument; the return value will determine whether there'll be a retried request.
  * `retry_after`: time (in seconds) after which there request will be retried. Can be an integer or a callable that receives the request and returns an integer (one can do exponential back-off like that, for example).
* Added support for DNS-over-HTTPS GET requests as per the latest spec.

## Improvements

* `HTTPX.plugins` got deprecated; basically, it's great until you have to pass options to a plugin, and then it just works (not). The recommended way to load multiple plugins is `HTTPX.plugin(...).plugin(...)`.


## Bugfixes

* fixed a proxy bug where an `Alt-Svc` response header would make the client try to connect. Just like connection coalescing and the ORIGIN frame, it ignores it when going through a proxy.
