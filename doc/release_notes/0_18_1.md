# 0.18.1

## Bugfixes

* HTTP/1.1 pipelining logs were logging the previously-buffered requests all together for each triggered request, which created some confusion for users when reporting errors. This has been fixed.
* HTTP/2 coalescing is now skipped when performing TLS connections with VERIFY_NONE.
* HTTP/2 peer GOAWAY frames will now result in a (retryable) connection error, instead of being ignored and leaving a "ghost" connection behind.
* fixed total timeout call which was not raising the exception.

## Chore

This gem now requires MFA-based gem releases.
