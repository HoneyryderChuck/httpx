`httpx` v0.19.0, the first major (minor version) update of 2022 of the ruby HTTP "swiss-army-knife" client, has just been released. It brings a lot of improvements and bugfixes, as well as a feature that has been a long time coming.

But first, I'd like to share with you my "weekend project".

## curl to httpx

Presenting you the new addition to the [httpx website](https://honeyryderchuck.gitlab.io/httpx/): `curl to httpx`, a small widget where you can paste a `curl` command and get the equivalent `httpx` ruby code snippet.

### Why?

As the maintainer of `httpx`, I mostly interact with users via bug reports, and focus on "making it work". But sometimes, I get to see how others use it, and there's things to point out usually: users tend to forget error handling (`response.raise_for_status`), reimplement `httpx` native features (`http.post(url, body: JSON.parse(hash), headers: {"content-type" => "application/json"})` instead of `http.post(url, json: hash)`, handling retries or redirects themselves...), among other things.

Although there's plenty of documentation (and a [wiki](https://honeyryderchuck.gitlab.io/httpx/wiki/home.html)), I'm mindful that most users don't have the time to go through it, and "whatever works first" is a decent success metric. It could be better though. But how?

Turns out I wasn't the first to think about it. Recently I found [curl-to-ruby](https://jhawthorn.github.io/curl-to-ruby/), a webform which translates `curl`-based commands ([curl](https://curl.se/) is used extensively to query HTTP APIs) into ruby code using the `net-http` standard library (this webform is itself based on [curl-to-go](https://mholt.github.io/curl-to-go/), a similar tool for the `go` language). I found it pretty cool, because it diminishes the cognitive load (and inevitably going through several `net-http` cheatsheet and "how-to-make-sense-of-net-http" websites) of using `net-http`'s terrible API, and still get the benefit of not installing another HTTP client gem.

I'd like to think that `httpx` API isn't that terrible, however it's still a pretty useful tool. So I looked on how to adapt it to use `httpx` instead. One issue though: `curl-to-ruby` code is Javascript. I wasn't excited at the prospect of programming Javascript to generate ruby code.

So I started looking into how to solve this problem using ruby instead.

### How?

The first step was to develop a simple script, using stdlib's [optparse](https://github.com/ruby/optparse), which would "parse" the `curl` call and paste the ruby script using `httpx` to standard out. That turned out to be straightforward, even if repetitive (there are >100 `curl` cli options):

```ruby
# something like:
require "optparse"

# ...

options = {}
OptionParser.new do |opts|
	opts.on("--basic") do #         Use HTTP Basic Authentication
		options[:auth] = :basic_authentication
		options[:auth_method] = :basic_auth
	end
	opts.on("-F", "--form NAME=CONTENT") do |data|
	# ... and so one ...
	end
end.parse(curl_command)

puts to_httpx(options)
```

The second step was to compile it to Javascript that could be used in the website. For that, I used [opal](https://github.com/opal/opal), a known "ruby to javascript" compiler.

```ruby
# the gist of how handling inputs via opal/js
on_txt_change = lambda do |evt|
	command = `#{evt}.target.value`
	options = {}
	urls = parse_options(command, options)
	output = to_httpx_output(urls, options)
end

%x{
	var input = document.getElementById('curl-command-input');
	input.addEventListener('input', on_txt_change, false);
	input.addEventListener('change', on_txt_change, false);
}
```

I may switch to using WASM in the future, now that [ruby will support webassembly](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18462), but this works well for now.

Then it was a matter of adding the HTML input tags in the `jekyll` templates, and it was a wrap.

(It took more than a weekend though ðŸ˜‚).

Doing this type of integration using (mostly) ruby felt very enabling. Cheers to the commmunity! Hope you find the widget useful.

Now, back to the `v0.19.0` feature announcements.

## Happy Eyeballs v2

The main new feature coming in `v0.19.0` is Happy Eyeballs support. If you want to know about it in detail [you can read the RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8305). But the tl;dr is: the DNS layer will request for IPv6 and IPv4 addresses in parallel, and privilege IPv6 connectivity whenever possible (under the conditions defined by the RFC).

### Why?

Prior to `v0.19.0`, `httpx` would resolve hostnames by first attempting an IPv4 address resolution (DNS A record), and only if the request would fail it'd request for an IPv6 address (DNS AAAA record). In a nutshell, "IPv4 first".

This decision was taken a long time ago, due to personal experiences with poor quality IPv6-enabled networks, and an assumption that if you target "stable legacy" IPv4 connectivity, I'd have less worries about support.

Yet this always seemed counter-intuitive to `httpx` mission: it enables seamless HTTP/2, but it gets you stuck with IPv4? That sounds off. Sure, ruby's mainly used in the cloud, where private networks have been IPv4-only for a long time, but [that's changing](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/dual-stack-ipv6-architectures-for-aws-and-hybrid-networks/).

### How?

All of the DNS strategies are using it now. The `:native` (default, pure ruby) resolver opens 2 sockets, one for each IP family, and uses them for each request; the `:https` (DoH) resolver uses the same HTTP/2 connection to multiplex both requests; the `:system` resolver was modified to use `getaddrinfo` (and doesn't block anymore), which already does dual-stack under the hood. Caches are also dual-stack aware, as is the hosts resolver.

One thing to note is that both the `:native` and `:https` resolver are [DNS-based load balancing friendly](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-dns-load-balancing/), whereas the `:system` resolver is not, due to its reliance on `getaddrinfo`, which [orders IPs before handing them to the caller](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/22132), thereby changing the order in which they were returned by the DNS server.


## Wrap up

There were also [plenty of improvements in the proxy layer, and another round of bugfixes](https://honeyryderchuck.gitlab.io/httpx/rdoc/files/doc/release_notes/0_19_0_md.html). Give it a try!
