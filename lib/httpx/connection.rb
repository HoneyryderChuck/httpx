  # The Connection can be watched for IO events.
  #
  # It contains the +io+ object to read/write from, and knows what to do when it can.
  #
  # It defers connecting until absolutely necessary. Connection should be triggered from
  # the IO selector (until then, any request will be queued).
  #
  # A connection boots up its parser after connection is established. All pending requests
  # will be redirected there after connection.
  #
  # A connection can be prevented from closing by the parser, that is, if there are pending
  # requests. This will signal that the connection was prematurely closed, due to a possible
  # number of conditions:
  #
  # * Remote peer closed the connection ("Connection: close");
  # * Remote peer doesn't support pipelining;
  #
  # A connection may also route requests for a different host for which the +io+ was connected
  # to, provided that the IP is the same and the port and scheme as well. This will allow to
  # share the same socket to send HTTP/2 requests to different hosts.
